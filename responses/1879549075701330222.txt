### Prediction for a Potential Fight Between Islam Makachev and Arman Tsarukyan:
Given that I couldn't retrieve the latest fight history for Islam Makachev, I can make a general analysis based on their fighting styles and previous performances:

- **Islam Makachev**: Known for his exceptional grappling skills and effective striking, Makachev has developed a strong submission game and has been consistently improving his stand-up technique. He often looks to take the fight to the ground where he can leverage his wrestling and submission skills.

- **Arman Tsarukyan**: Tsarukyan is a well-rounded fighter with solid grappling and striking abilities. He has showcased effective striking combinations and can compete on the ground, though he tends to favor striking when possible.

**Outcome Prediction**: 
If Islam Makachev and Arman Tsarukyan were to fight again, I would predict that Islam Makachev would likely win, possibly by a submission in the later rounds (3rd round) due to his grappling proficiency and ability to control fights on the ground. 

**Method of Victory**: Submission (likely a rear-naked choke or arm triangle) in Round 3.

### Rationale:
- Makachev's experience and grappling acumen give him a significant advantage in controlling the pace and location of the fight.
- Tsarukyan has improved since their last encounter, but Makachev's current form and fight IQ could allow him to capitalize on any openings in Tsarukyan's game.
