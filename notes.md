### Pseudocode
Below is a **step-by-step** tutorial on how to set up a simple Twitter bot on your **Raspberry Pi 5** that automatically responds to mentions. We’ll assume you’ll use **polling** (i.e., checking Twitter every X seconds/minutes) instead of a webhook to keep things simpler, avoid needing a static IP or special router setup, and keep everything running locally on your Pi.

## 1. Initial Raspberry Pi Setup

Since you have a **CanaKit Raspberry Pi 5** bundle with Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) pre-loaded on a microSD:

1. **Insert the SD card** (which already has Raspberry Pi OS) into your Raspberry Pi 5.  
2. **Connect** an HDMI monitor, keyboard, and mouse (or you can go headless and SSH in—see below).  
3. **Plug in the CanaKit 45W PD Power Supply** to power it on.

If it’s your first boot, you’ll go through a quick **Raspberry Pi OS setup wizard**:
- Select your **language** and **time zone**.  
- Change the **default password** (important for security).  
- Connect to **Wi-Fi** (if you’re not using Ethernet).  
- Let it **update** if prompted (sometimes the OS auto-updates on first boot).

---

## 2. Connect to Your Pi (SSH or Local)

### Option A: Directly on the Pi
If you have a monitor and keyboard connected, you can do everything on the Pi’s desktop.

### Option B: SSH from Your M4 Mac
1. **Enable SSH** on the Pi:  
   - On the Pi’s desktop, open **Settings** → **Interfaces** → enable **SSH**.  
   - Or from a terminal on the Pi:  
     ```bash
     sudo raspi-config
     ```
     Navigate to **Interface Options** → **SSH** → enable.
2. **Find Pi’s IP address** (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) by running:
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```
3. **SSH from your Mac** (replace IP with your Pi’s actual IP):
   ```bash
   ssh pi@192.168.x.x
   ```
   - Enter the password you set during the Pi’s setup.

---

## 3. System Updates & Python Environment

Let’s make sure everything is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

Raspberry Pi OS comes with **Python 3** pre-installed. Verify by running:

```bash
python3 --version
```

It should show something like `Python 3.9.x` or later.

If you want a clean environment, install `python3-venv` (if not already installed) so we can create a virtual environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
```

Create and activate a **virtual environment** (optional but good practice):
```bash
python3 -m venv ~/twitter-bot-env
source ~/twitter-bot-env/bin/activate
```
(Note: You’ll need to re-run that `source ...` command whenever you open a new terminal session, unless you automate it.)

---

## 4. Obtain Twitter API Credentials

You’ll need **API keys** to interact with Twitter:

1. **Twitter Developer Portal**: [developer.twitter.com](https://developer.twitter.com/)  
2. Create a **new project** and **app**.  
3. Generate the following **keys/tokens** (in “Keys and tokens” section):  
   - **API Key** (Consumer Key)  
   - **API Secret Key** (Consumer Secret)  
   - **Access Token**  
   - **Access Token Secret**  
4. **Keep these secret**. We’ll put them in environment variables or a config file on the Pi.

---

## 5. Install Tweepy & Other Dependencies

Within your virtual environment, install [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/), a common Python library for Twitter:

```bash
pip install tweepy
```

(If you’re **not** in a virtual environment, just use `pip3` instead.)

If you plan to use an external AI API (like OpenAI), also install that:

```bash
pip install openai
```

---

## 6. Create the Bot Python Script

Create a file, say `twitter_bot.py`, in your home directory (`/home/pi`):

```bash
nano twitter_bot.py
```

Paste in the following example code (we’ll walk through it below). This script:
1. Authenticates with Twitter using Tweepy.
2. Polls mentions every 60 seconds.
3. Replies to new mentions with a simple message.

```python
import os
import tweepy
import time

# If you're using external AI (e.g. OpenAI), import it here
# import openai

# =========== Configuration =============
# We pull credentials from environment variables for simplicity
API_KEY = os.getenv('TWITTER_API_KEY')
API_SECRET = os.getenv('TWITTER_API_SECRET')
ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv('TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN')
ACCESS_SECRET = os.getenv('TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET')

# =========== Tweepy Auth ================
auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_SECRET)
api = tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True, wait_on_rate_limit_notify=True)

# We'll track the last mention ID to avoid replying multiple times
LAST_MENTION_FILE = 'last_mention_id.txt'

def get_last_mention_id():
    """
    Read the last mention ID we processed from file, or 1 if file doesn't exist.
    """
    if os.path.exists(LAST_MENTION_FILE):
        with open(LAST_MENTION_FILE, 'r') as f:
            return int(f.read().strip())
    else:
        return 1

def set_last_mention_id(mention_id):
    """
    Update the last mention ID in the file.
    """
    with open(LAST_MENTION_FILE, 'w') as f:
        f.write(str(mention_id))

def check_mentions():
    """
    Poll Twitter for new mentions and reply to them.
    """
    last_mention_id = get_last_mention_id()
    # Get mentions since the last ID
    mentions = api.mentions_timeline(since_id=last_mention_id, tweet_mode='extended')
    
    for mention in reversed(mentions):
        print(f"New mention from @{mention.user.screen_name}: {mention.full_text}")
        
        # Compose your AI-based reply or a simple greeting
        reply_text = f"Hello @{mention.user.screen_name}, thanks for the mention! (Pi-powered bot)"
        
        # Post the reply
        api.update_status(
            status=reply_text,
            in_reply_to_status_id=mention.id,
            auto_populate_reply_metadata=True
        )
        # Update the last mention ID
        last_mention_id = mention.id
    
    if mentions:
        set_last_mention_id(last_mention_id)

def main():
    print("Starting Twitter bot... Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
    while True:
        check_mentions()
        time.sleep(60)  # wait 60 seconds

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Press **Ctrl+O** to save, then **Ctrl+X** to exit `nano`.

## 7. Test the Bot Manually

1. **Set environment variables** with your Twitter credentials. You can either:
   - Export them in your shell session:
     ```bash
     export TWITTER_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
     export TWITTER_API_SECRET="YOUR_API_SECRET"
     export TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
     export TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET="YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET"
     ```
   - (Optional) Add those lines to `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.profile`) so they’re always set when you log in.

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python3 twitter_bot.py
   ```
   or if you’re in the virtual environment,
   ```bash
   python twitter_bot.py
   ```

3. **Trigger a mention**:
   - Log in to a different Twitter account (or your main one if the bot is a separate handle).  
   - Send a tweet mentioning your bot’s Twitter handle, e.g. “@YourBotHandle Hello from me!”

4. **Check the Pi terminal**:  
   - It should detect the new mention and reply.  
   - You should see console output like:  
     ```
     New mention from @someone: @YourBotHandle Hello from me!
     ```
   - It replies with: “Hello @someone, thanks for the mention! (Pi-powered bot)”.

If it works, you’ll see the reply on Twitter within a minute.  

---

## 8. Run the Bot in the Background

You probably don’t want to keep your terminal open forever. Two common approaches:

### 8.1 Using `screen` or `tmux`
1. Install `screen` (if not installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install screen
   ```
2. Start a screen session:
   ```bash
   screen -S twitterbot
   ```
3. Run your bot:
   ```bash
   python3 twitter_bot.py
   ```
4. Detach from screen (without stopping the script) by pressing `Ctrl+A`, then `D`.  
5. Log out of SSH, and your bot keeps running.  
6. To reattach:
   ```bash
   screen -r twitterbot
   ```

### 8.2 Using a `systemd` Service
For a more “production-like” approach, create a service file:

1. **Create** a service unit file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/twitterbot.service
   ```
2. **Paste** the following (adjust paths as needed):
   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=Twitter Bot Service
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=pi
   WorkingDirectory=/home/pi
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/twitter_bot.py
   Restart=always

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
3. **Reload systemd** and **enable** the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable twitterbot.service
   sudo systemctl start twitterbot.service
   ```
4. **Check status**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status twitterbot.service
   ```
   You should see logs confirming the bot is running.  

This way, your bot automatically starts at boot and restarts if it crashes.

---

## 9. Troubleshooting & Tips

1. **Check Logs**: If using `systemd`, you can view real-time logs with:
   ```bash
   journalctl -u twitterbot.service -f
   ```
2. **Permission Errors**:  
   - Ensure your `twitter_bot.py` is **executable** (not strictly required, but good practice):
     ```bash
     chmod +x twitter_bot.py
     ```
   - Ensure your `last_mention_id.txt` is writable by the `pi` user.
3. **No Mentions Detected**:  
   - Make sure you’re mentioning the **correct** handle (`@YourBotHandle`).  
   - Double-check your **Twitter credentials**.
4. **Rate Limits**:  
   - Twitter has rate limits. If you poll too often or your code frequently updates statuses, you could get limited. Tweepy’s `wait_on_rate_limit=True` helps but be mindful.
5. **Add AI**:  
   - If you want the bot’s reply to be AI-generated, integrate your AI code (e.g., `openai.Completion.create(...)`) inside the `check_mentions()` function.  
   - Format the reply based on the AI model’s output.

# Final Summary

- You **already have** a Raspberry Pi 5 kit with Raspberry Pi OS pre-loaded.  
- **Update** your Pi, set up **Python** and **Tweepy**, then **create** a simple polling script (`twitter_bot.py`).  
- **Obtain** Twitter API credentials from the Twitter Developer portal and store them securely (environment variables).  
- **Test** the bot by running it in the foreground, then **deploy** it in the background using either `screen`/`tmux` or a `systemd` service.  
- Your Pi now runs a simple mention-reply bot without requiring any ongoing cloud cost (beyond your home internet and electricity usage).

With this setup, your Pi-based Twitter bot will happily run 24/7 in your home. Enjoy your **Pi-powered** AI or simple mention-responder!





--------------------------------

The code provided uses **Tweepy** and interacts with the **Twitter v2 API** for most operations, such as posting tweets and retweeting.

### Key Details:
1. **Twitter v2 API**:
   - **`tweepy.Client`**:
     - The `Client` object in Tweepy is specifically designed for interacting with the **Twitter v2 API**.
     - Methods like `create_tweet` and `retweet` are part of the v2 API.

2. **Twitter v1.1 API**:
   - **`tweepy.API`**:
     - The `API` object is used for media uploads in the provided code. This is part of the **Twitter v1.1 API**, as media-related operations (e.g., `api.media_upload`) are not yet available in v2.

---

### Breakdown of API Usage in the Code:

#### **Twitter v2 API (via `Client`):**
- **`client.create_tweet`:**
  - Posts a tweet or a reply using the v2 API.
- **`client.retweet`:**
  - Retweets a tweet by its ID using the v2 API.

#### **Twitter v1.1 API (via `API`):**
- **`api.media_upload`:**
  - Uploads media (e.g., images) using the v1.1 API.

---

### Why Both APIs Are Used:
- The v2 API is newer and supports most tweet-related operations.
- The v1.1 API is still required for media uploads because media-related endpoints are not yet fully available in the v2 API.

---

### Conclusion:
Your code uses **both Twitter v1.1 and v2 APIs**, leveraging the v2 API for tweets and retweets, and the v1.1 API for media uploads. Let me know if you'd like to fully transition to v2 (if media upload becomes available) or need further clarification!
