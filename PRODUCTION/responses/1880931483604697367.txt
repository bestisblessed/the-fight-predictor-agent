### Prediction

**Likely Outcome:** Justin Gaethje wins by KO/TKO in Round 2.

#### Rationale:
1. **Striking Power:** Gaethje possesses exceptional knockout power, demonstrated by his high percentage of KO victories. Against Hooker, who has shown susceptibility to strikes in past fights, Gaethje's striking will likely be a significant advantage.

2. **Fight Style:** Both fighters are known for their striking, but Gaethje's pressure fighting style and ability to absorb damage could tilt the fight in his favor. He often overwhelms opponents with a relentless pace and powerful leg kicks.

3. **Recent Performance:** While both fighters have similar recent win rates, Gaethje's ability to finish fights early and decisively gives him an edge. Hooker has been more active recently, but Gaethjeâ€™s experience in high-stakes fights (like title fights) could benefit him.

4. **Game Plan:** Gaethje is likely to adopt a game plan focused on striking exchanges, looking to exploit Hooker's defensive gaps. Given Hooker's previous losses to aggressive strikers, this could play a crucial role in the fight's outcome.

### Conclusion

Considering the striking dynamics, recent performances, and fight history, I predict that Justin Gaethje will secure a victory over Dan Hooker by KO/TKO in the second round of the fight.
