    - There is 100% the data you need in there. Figure it out.


### Generating Visualizations ###
- Make a pie chart of all of his method of victories in the three categories knockout, submission, decision. Put the total number of each category inside the chart as well.
    -  ***I believe that image just included his UFC outcomes and methods of victories. Use the fighter info file for his entire careers numbers for the pi chart.***   
- Make a bar chart of his last 5 fights and the number of significant strikes landed and attempted.
- Now generate me an insightful visualization using data/trends/etc. you find in the data. Make it advanced/insightful enough that they could help a professional gambler in Las Vegas find sharp edges - not just a simple win/loss/draw kind of shit. 
    - Make a more advanced and insightful one using seaborn and a more advanced graph
    - Make a more advanced and insightful one using plotly and a more advanced graph
    - Make a more advanced and insightful one using matplotlib and a more advanced graph
